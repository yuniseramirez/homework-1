# Homework 1

This homework assignment covers the content that we discussed in class up until and including February 5.


## GitHub

We will exlusively use GitHub for all assignments in this class. Therefore (and because it is broadly used in industry), you should familiarize yourself with GitHub and its features.

### 1. Learn about GitHub

Perform this "Hello World" exercise: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/


### 2. Understand Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a language for simple text formatting. Usually, markdown files end in `.md` (like this file, `README.md`).

You will complete this homework assignment by modifying this Markdown file (`README.md`).

Take a look at these resources to understand Markdown basics:

* https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/
* https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
* https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet


### 3. Modify README

Read about the `README.md` file: https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/

Now, edit the `README.md` file in this homework repository by clicking the `README.md` file in the list of files:

![README file](images/readme.png)

Then click the pencil icon to edit it:

![Edit button](./images/edit.png)

Next, edit this line to add your name: **Your Name**

Click the "Preview changes" tab to see your changes.

When you are happy with your changes, click the "Commit changes" button at the bottom (optionally entering a commit title and description):

![Commit](./images/commit.png)

You should now see your name above (instead of "Your Name"). You can also see your change in the repository's commit history.


### 4. LinkedIn profile URL

[LinkedIn](linkedin.com) is a professional networking site used by almost all companies and recruiters. By establishing your professional profile now, to can begin to connect with other classmates and build your professional network.

Please sign up for LinkedIn and share your LinkedIn profile URL here. If you do not wish to be a member of LinkedIn, please write "I decline.":

[My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/.../)


### 5. Setup GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a feature of GitHub that lets you serve webpages directly from a GitHub repository.

You will need to do this once for each homework assignment and class project.

Click the "Settings" tab in your repository:

![Settings tab](./images/settings.png)

Enable GitHub Pages on the master branch:

![GitHub Pages](./images/gh-pages.png)

After saving, note the public URL of your repository -- you will use this in the "Writing Code" section below:

![GitHub Pages URL](./images/gh-pages-url.png)
